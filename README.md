- 👋 Hi, I’m @vineelrk
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, specifically cybersecurity as a professional career. other hobbies of mine including taking MOOCs to learn extra information, sculpting ceramic figures/sculptures, and reading historical fiction novels.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science and programming languages such as C++ to get a feel for the universal coding syntax, which will allow me to learn C, Python, Java, etc. more efficiently. I am also learning about Cybersecurity through online courses and reading articles.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-level coding projects, the type you would expect a college first-year with relatively little experience to work on, like a guided coding project in C++ or another language if the basics will be taught during some form of training.
